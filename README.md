# Other Apps for Mac
Apart from making Open source libraries I also make apps for Mac OS. Please have a look.

## [Lexi](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/lexi-visual-json-browser/id1462580127?mt=12)
Lexi is a split screen app that lets you browse large JSON with ease.

It also has other featuers like `Prettify JSON`, `Minify JSON` `Copy JSON Path` and `Pin Large JSON` to narrow your visibility

## [Quick Note](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/quicknote-one-click-notes/id1472935217?mt=12) 
Quick Note is a Mac OS app, lets you quickly add text either from Menu bar or from Shortcut.

The text floats on other windows so that they are always visible

It also supports `Auto Save` and `Pinned Notes`
